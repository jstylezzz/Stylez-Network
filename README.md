# MAJOR REWRITE!

I'm currently doing a complete rewrite of the framework. I could have re-initialized the repo, but I chose to simply
replace the files I'm working with instead. Right now, the progress can be seen in the dev-rewrite branch.

This version is (and will continue to be) better documented, and hopefully even more stable and easy to use.
